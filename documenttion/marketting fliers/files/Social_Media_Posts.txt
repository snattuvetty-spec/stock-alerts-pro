POST #3 - STORY FORMAT (Personal Share)
===========================================

So I missed another great trading opportunity last week because I wasn't watching the charts... 😤

That's when I decided to build Stock Alerts Pro.

Here's the problem I was facing (maybe you have it too?):

❌ Can't watch stock prices all day
❌ Miss good buy/sell opportunities  
❌ Set price alerts on my broker but they're delayed
❌ Want notifications on my phone, not just desktop

So I built an app that solves ALL of this:

✅ Instant Telegram notifications to my phone
✅ Also sends beautiful email alerts
✅ Checks prices every 2 minutes (real-time!)
✅ Works for ANY stock on NASDAQ/NYSE
✅ Super simple to set up (took me 2 minutes)

Best part? 

🎁 It's FREE for 21 days
💰 Then just $2/month (no commitment, cancel anytime)

I'm opening it up to a small group of beta testers. If you want in, just comment "interested" or send me a message!

Who else struggles with missing good trades? 🙋‍♂️

POST #5 - PROBLEM/SOLUTION (Educational)
===========================================

❓ QUESTION: How many times have you thought "I should have bought that stock at $X" but missed it?

🙋‍♂️ Happens to me ALL the time!

The problem? We can't watch stock prices 24/7.

The solution? Stock Alerts Pro 📊

Here's how it works:

1️⃣ You pick a stock (say, Tesla)
2️⃣ You set your target price (say, $200)
3️⃣ Choose "alert when price goes BELOW $200"
4️⃣ We monitor it for you 24/7
5️⃣ When Tesla hits $200 → INSTANT alert to your phone!

No more:
❌ Missing opportunities
❌ Watching charts all day
❌ Setting calendar reminders
❌ Delayed broker alerts

Instead:
✅ Get instant notifications
✅ Go about your day normally
✅ Only check when it matters
✅ Never miss your target price

And right now? It's FREE for 21 days.

No credit card. No commitment. Just try it!
